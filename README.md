# Organic Hut (Website using ML)
So here I have tried a new approach to Online Grocery Shopping.
Upon opening, the user is brought to the landing page of the website which at background cycles between actual isle to isle live footage. Here is where the Machine Learning is used.
The user can see the stock on display in real time and choose what they want.
The stock is updated every 5 minutes.
There will be actual cameras set up in the physical store to give a live preview to the user on the website.
The clever machine learning here is also used to study the shopping products of the user and show them personalized recipes.
This can be the first step to a complete revolution & mixing of reality & virtuality.
